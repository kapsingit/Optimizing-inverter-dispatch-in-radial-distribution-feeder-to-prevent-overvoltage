# Optimizing-inverter-dispatch-in-radial-distribution-feeder-to-prevent-overvoltage
Performs optimization in 12 house radial feeder based distribution system to find out optimal inverter dispatch. The objective being minimizing the total energy curtailment. Fairness of curtailment between different PV houses is also included.
